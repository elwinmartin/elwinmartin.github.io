So when I get rid of my GTI I am going to need to replace it with a reasonably reliable daily driver. I would strongly prefer something incredibly reliable to remove the "headache" factor that comes into play with having many tiny repairs that may not cost much, so minimal service cost is going to take a premium over other features until I'm much more financially comfortable.


I would like to keep my car payments well within my means so that I can make progress on my student loans. I am also interested in keeping my monthly payments low, perhaps at the expense net money spent, in exchange for peace of mind should I find myself in a financial emergency.


I think this leads me to a either of a new leased car or a lightly used (fresh off a lease, perhaps) new-ish car.


That said, I am still looking at having a 'fun' car that's meant to be driven on weekends. I would like it to be road legal and registered, so there are some limitations there.

*Addenda: 8/11*

I have seen too, too many Lexus IS 250s and BMW 328is for sale and am completely sick of them. There must be people who would love either, but they get in the way when searching for affordable RWD vehicles -- thanks, but no thanks. 

## The Daily Driver

For a daily driver, space is one of my main concerns. I want space for two people and some instruments (a bass guitar is a good reference point, here). As much as I would love to daily an ND Miata...you have to make a choice between bringing *a* (yes, one) friend or bringing stuff with you. This is hard to stomach when I need to carpool or get to rehearsals. 

With that in mind, hatchbacks/wagons fill my needs particularly well though I may prefer a 2+2 seater or even a sedan to save cash for the fun car.   

I have zero qualms with an automatic transmission, though I would prefer a good dual clutch.


### New Leased

1. Honda Civic (Sport Trim)

2. VW GTI (Base)

3. Toyota 86 (Base)

### Used Financed

1. Scion FRS (Base)

2. Hyundai Genesis (2.0 L Turbo) 

3. Subaru WRX (Base, not STI)


## Weekend / Project Cars

The options listed here are not the only ones I'm willing to consider. There are a lot of great cars out there, but I need to narrow things down to reasonable choices. If we're being real with ourselves...the Miata is the clear front runner.

1. Mazda Miata, Miata, Miata (NA/NB/NC)

2. Chevy C4 Corvette

3. Nissan 240SX / 300ZX

4. BMW Z3 / E36 M3

5. Honda S2000

6. Toyota MR2 Spyder / Toyota Celica

7. Foxbody Mustang

8. Lexus SC


#### Miatas

There is so much aftermarket support and such a large community around these cars that it's hard not to buy one. There are only a handful of tools needed for any one repair or installation, too.

I would want to make this a streetable track car that approaches the standards of Spec Miata. Early installations would include new seats, tires, and wheels. Suspension upgrades would come after I got a better sense of its limits. I would definitely invest in a roll bar if I got even remotely fast. 

I could see supercharging or turbocharging depending on the condition of the car. While I want this to be a performance vehicle first, I don't want to hate looking at it or sitting in it. Turbo kits are practically bolt on for NA/NB motors and I believe that the internals are good for low boost. I am a little worried about losing the great surge of torque I get in my GTI, but hopefully driving a higher revving car for a bit can assuage that. I would want to budget for this pretty carefully if I went through with it.  

#### Corvettes

Old Corvettes are pretty popular for autocross still and it would be the best kind of silly to own one.

#### Nissan Drifters



#### BMWs

These are bad ideas and definitely pushing my budget, but I don't think it's rare to have a weakness for German cars. 

#### S2Ks



#### Toyota Coupes



#### Mustangs

I would probably want a Foxbody, likely with ~100-200k miles on it (ideally less on the engine). Below 5 grand is definitely doable shopping around some. For example, I found a 1990 for $2600. I would definitely be willing to push for a more recent / lower mileage / better condition, before condition car at the higher range of my budget. These cars are old enough that there should be some money budgeted for larger repairs upfront. 


#### JZ Lexi


Found an SC400 with 176k miles for under 6 grand. Keeping it to 2000 at newest to get the 2JZ engine.
