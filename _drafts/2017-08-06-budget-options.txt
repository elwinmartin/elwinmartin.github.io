So when I get rid of my GTI I am going to need to replace it with a reasonably reliable daily driver. I would strongly prefer something incredibly reliable to remove the "headache" factor that comes into play with having many tiny repairs that may not cost much, so minimal service cost is going to take a premium over other features until I'm much more financially comfortable.


I would like to keep my car payments well within my means so that I can make progress on my student loans. I am also interested in keeping my monthly payments low, perhaps at the expense net money spent, in exchange for peace of mind should I find myself in a financial emergency.


I think this leads me to a either a new leased car or a lightly used (fresh off a lease, perhaps) new-ish car.


That said, I am still looking at having a 'fun' car that's meant to be driven on weekends. I would like it to be road legal and registered, so there are some limitations there.


## The Daily Driver

For a daily driver, space is one of my main concerns. I want space for two people and some instruments (a bass guitar is a good reference point, here). As much as I would love to daily a Miata...it would mean choosing between bringing *a* (yes, singular) friend or bringing stuff with me. Not sure I can manage this with my commitments to rehearsals and daily carpooling right now. 

With that in mind, hatchbacks/wagons fill my needs particularly well though I may prefer a 2+2 seater or even a sedan to save cash for the fun car.   

I have zero qualms with an automatic transmission, though I would prefer a good dual clutch.


### New Leased

0. Honda Fit (Sport Trim)

1. Honda Civic (Sport Trim)

2. VW GTI (Base)

3. Toyota 86 (Base)

### Used Financed

1. Scion FRS (Base)

2. Hyundai Genesis (2.0 L Turbo) 

3. Subaru WRX (Base, not STI)

This has been on and off my list of 'maybe I should get one eventually' cars for years. While I think I would prefer to jump to RWD, an AWD car would still be a new experience and there is nothing inherently wrong with them (beside, understeer apparently?). I can't recall driving anything with all four wheels powered, but if I did it wasn't in a situation where it would've mattered.

After following a decent bit of commentary on the subject, I've been mostly convinced the extra power for an STI is just not worth it for someone like me. The difference in cost for the power upgrades just doesn't justify itself when the base WRX is a good car on it's own. I still need to drive these to get an actual impression of how I like them, but I have a feeling it just wouldn't be worth going up in mileage to get the price down for an STI in my case.

This car is definitely not a good lease and the 2017s are leasing for monthly rates around what I would pay for a GT86...which is ridiculous, I would just get one of those instead. A used one would be near the limits of what I can justify budgeting on a new-ish car...at least for the car sold as a "WRX". I found a 2015 going for $20,900 with 35k miles. It's an automatic and I don't know how Subaru builds theirs, so it would be something I would have to look into and drive first.

I can't tell if these cars have always just been more expensive than I previously thought or if they just hold value surprisingly well? 



4. Ford Focus (ST)

#### Focus ST

This is an interesting option to me since it let's me drive a different, but intriguing hatchback.

These cars depreciate fairly aggressively in price, but most of the Focus reliability issues I see reported pertain to the automatic transmission. So they fit into a nice bin of cheap cars that are not too awful to maintain. I am not expecting Honda/Mazda reliability, but it would certainly be cheaper than what I deal with now.
Because of the transmission issue, I think for this car I would be getting a manual. 

It's too bad there are virtually no used Focus RS's for sale at a reasonable cost anywhere, if there were it would be on my list with higher mileage as an alternative to a WRX or Golf R. 

With respect to pricing, I've found a couple with low-ish miles for sub 15 grand. Specifically, cars.com has listings for 13-14,000 with mileage in the 20-30,000s for 2014 models. This is well within my realm of 'affordable' and would give me a much newer, fresher car with much less cosmetic and comfort issues. While Ford has gotten some criticism for their interiors (especially their electronics) in recent years -- I'm not imagining this, right? -- these are pretty minimal concerns for me as long as the visibility is okay and there is an aux port. I would want to put in some nicer bucket seats that are a bit less branded shortly after I got the car, honestly.

5. Volvo T60

## Weekend / Project Cars

The options listed here are not the only ones I'm willing to consider. There are a lot of great cars out there, but I need to narrow things down to reasonable choices. If we're being real with ourselves...the Miata is the clear front runner.

1. Mazda Miata, Miata, Miata (NA/NB/NC)

2. Chevy C4 Corvette

3. Nissan 240SX / 300ZX

4. BMW Z3 / E36 M3

5. Honda S2000

6. Toyota MR2 Spyder / Toyota Celica

7. Foxbody Mustang

8. Lexus SC


#### Miatas

There is so much aftermarket support and such a large community around these cars that it's hard not to buy one. There are only a handful of tools needed for any one repair or installation, too.

I would want to make this a streetable track car that approaches the standards of Spec Miata. Early installations would include new seats, tires, and wheels. Suspension upgrades would come after I got a better sense of its limits. I would definitely invest in a roll bar if I got even remotely fast. 

I could see supercharging or turbocharging depending on the condition of the car. While I want this to be a performance vehicle first, I don't want to hate looking at it or sitting in it. Turbo kits are practically bolt on for NA/NB motors and I believe that the internals are good for low boost. I am a little worried about losing the great surge of torque I get in my GTI, but hopefully driving a higher revving car for a bit can assuage that. I would want to budget for this pretty carefully if I went through with it.  

#### Corvettes

Old Corvettes are pretty popular for autocross still and it would be the best kind of silly to own one.

#### Nissan Drifters

A 240SX or a 300ZX would be pretty cool. I'm going to keep these in mind, but I don't know if I'm seriously considering them right now. A drift car is something I would like long term. Right now it would be great to have something fun to throw around without having to learn a new skill and buy lots of tires.


#### BMWs

Buying one is a bad idea and definitely pushing my budget, but I don't think it's rare to have a weakness for German cars.  

#### S2Ks



#### Toyota Coupes

I am slightly obsessed with the MR2 Spyder (aka the MRS or Mr. 2) at this point. I still need to drive one, but I have a feeling I would want to either swap for a Celica engine (+ transmission) or go forced-induction. I find these cars a little ugly from a few angles, so there are a number of aesthetic / performance changes I'd like to make out of the gate.

Driving a mid-engine car with poor handling is dangerous. Spin-to-win isn't a thing for driving; it's just an easy way to crash and possibly die. 


#### Mustangs

I would probably want a Foxbody, likely with ~100-200k miles on it (ideally less on the engine). Below 5 grand is definitely doable shopping around some. For example, I found a 1990 for $2600. I would definitely be willing to push for a more recent / lower mileage / better condition, before condition car at the higher range of my budget. These cars are old enough that there should be some money budgeted for larger repairs upfront. 


#### JZ Lexi


Found an SC400 with 176k miles for under 6 grand. Keeping it to 2000 at newest to get the 2JZ engine.
