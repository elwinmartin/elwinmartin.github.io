So when I get rid of my GTI I am going to need to replace it with a reasonably reliable daily driver. I would strongly prefer something incredibly reliable to remove the "headache" factor that comes into play with having many tiny repairs that may not cost much, so minimal service cost is going to take a premium over other features until I'm much more financially comfortable.


I would like to keep my car payments well within my means so that I can make progress on my student loans. I am also interested in keeping my monthly payments low, perhaps at the expense net money spent, in exchange for peace of mind should I find myself in a financial emergency.


I think this leads me to a either of a new leased car or a lightly used (fresh off a lease, perhaps) new-ish car.


That said, I am still looking at having a 'fun' car that's meant to be driven on weekends. I would like it to be road legal and registered, so there are some limitations there.

*Addenda: 8/11*

There are so, so many Lexus IS 250s and BMW 328is for sale that I am completely sick of them. I am sure there are people who would love to have either, but they are getting in the way when I look for RWD cars in my price range. Sorry car search engines and thanks, but no thanks. 

## New Leased ##

For a daily driver I am unlikely to compromise on space (for now). I need space for two people and some instruments (a bass guitar is a good reference point, here). As much as I would love to daily an ND Miata...you have to make a choice between bringing *a* (yes, one) friend or bringing stuff with you. This is hard to stomach as someone who both carpools and plays music. 

With that in mind, hatchbacks occupy my needs particularly well but I am not averse to a 2+2 with decent rear seats or even a boring sedan to save cash for the fun car.  

I have zero qualms with an automatic transmission, though I would prefer a good dual clutch.




1. Honda Civic (Sport Trim)

2. VW GTI (Base)

3. Hyundai Genesis (2.0 L Turbo) 

4. Scion FRS / Toyota 86 (Base)

## Used (Financed?) ##

I'm going to break down my options partially by brand here since that's going to make my life easier. There are a lot of options here, but let's be real with ourselves...the Miata is the clear front runner.

Weekend Cars:

1. Miata, Miata, Miata (NA/NB/NC)

2. C4 Corvette

3. Nissan 240SX / 300ZX

4. BMW Z3 / E36 M3

5. Honda S2000

6. Toyota MR2

MR2 Spyder

7. Mustang

8. Lexus SC

Found an SC400 with 176k miles for under 6 grand. Keeping it to 2000 at newest to get the 2JZ engine.

Fox body. ~100-200k miles most likely, < 5 grand is doable. Found 1990 for $2600 with a manual...so 2000-5000 is probably reasonable depending on condition, before any sort of service needed.
