So my attention has been pulled in a few different directions during this long and occasionally painful process. Fortunately, spending hours researching and checking out cars has helped distill my needs and wants down to a few core features.

The following is what I've deemed important for a daily driver (in order):

0. Four seats
1. $$\leq 12,000$$ USD
2. Power to weight (really, torque to weight) $$\stackrel{>=}{\sim}$$ better than my GTI
3. Quick transmission
4. Steering feel
5. AWD $$>=$$ RWD $$>>$$ FWD 
6. $$< 3,500$$ lbs

For my weekend / track car I "need" the following:

1. $$<4,000$$ USD (at purchase) 
2. $$<3,000$$ lbs
3. Manual
4. RWD
5. Must Run

For the fun car I'll be looking at a Toyota MR2 Spyder in the coming weeks. 
If the pre-purchase inspection picks up anything that's more than about a grand to fix 
then I will probably aim for a Kei (è»½) car. A Honda Beat would be perfect and there are
a growing number available for import from Japan at modest mileage. 
A tiny turbo or motorcycle engine swap could be an easy way to make one very quick, too.

The daily driver has been a struggle for me. Budgeting for performance and reliability 
is easier said than done for a sedan or 2+2 coupe. I am still sort of interested in a hot 
hatch or wagon (Volvo or Saab, maybe?) but checking out a "spotless" 92-X Aero that had hidden subframe 
damage selling for $9,000 has sort of dampened my interest. 

I checked out a 300ZX 2+2 with a TT engine swapped in but it seemed like the vehicle would need several grand worth of work to bring it back to its former glory.
