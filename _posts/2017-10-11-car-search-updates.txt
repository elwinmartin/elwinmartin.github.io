So my attention has been pulled in a few different directions during this long and occasionally painful process. Fortunately, spending hours researching and checking out cars has helped distill my needs and wants down to a few core features.

The following is what I've deemed important for a daily driver (in order):

0. Four seats and a place *I* can be comfortable 
1. $12,000 or less to keep the payments reasonable
2. Power to weight (really, torque to weight) >=~ better than my GTI
3. A quick transmission
4. Steering feel with minimal dead
5. AWD >= RWD >> FWD 
6. < 3,5000 lbs

For my weekend / track car I "need" the following:

1. Max of $4,000 initial cost
2. Hard max of 3,000 lbs
3. Manual transmission
4. RWD
5. Must Run
