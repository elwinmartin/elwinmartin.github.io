So my attention has been pulled in a few different directions during this long and occasionally painful process. Fortunately, spending hours researching and checking out cars has helped distill my needs and wants down to a few core features. 


<!--more-->

The following is what I've deemed important for a daily driver (in order):

0. Four seats
1. $$\leq 12,000$$ USD
2. Power to weight (really, torque to weight) $$\stackrel{>=}{\sim}$$ better than my GTI
3. Quick transmission
4. Steering feel
5. AWD $$>=$$ RWD $$>>$$ FWD 
6. $$< 3,500$$ lbs

For my weekend / track car I "need" the following:

1. $$<4,000$$ USD (at purchase) 
2. $$<3,000$$ lbs
3. Manual
4. RWD
5. Must Run


# The Search

So let's review the kinds of things I'm looking for and some of the vehicles I've checked out.

## Weekend / Track Car

For the fun car I'll be looking at a Toyota MR2 Spyder in the coming weeks. 
If the pre-purchase inspection picks up anything that's more than about a grand to fix 
then I will probably aim for a Kei (è»½) car. A Honda Beat would be perfect and there are
a growing number available for import from Japan at modest mileage. 
A tiny turbo or motorcycle engine swap could be an easy way to make one very quick, too.

I had the pleasure of checking out two different low-budget Miatas recently. The first looked like a pretty solid deal. $1300 for a car that needed brakes and a couple of smaller things done, but seemed otherwise fine. The engine was in good condition and the body was rust-free. A friend came with me to test drive the car and help inspect he. He and I agreed that it was a reasonable price for the car as it was. The next day, I started to get the money out to buy the car and bought the parts needed to update the brakes. That afternoon I went to print and fill out a bill of sale but realized I didn't have the VIN. I texted the owner for the VIN + license number. Hours passed. No response came inspite of followup texts and a phone call. Tried once more the next day, but I never heard back from him. Probably dodged a bullet here.

The next miata was for sale at a similar price and the owner was really hoping to get rid of it as quickly as possible. They offered to drive it to me the same day I asked about it. That was at 10pm. I let them know that while I did have the money on hand, it seemed unreasonable for them to drive 45 minutes when I wasn't sure I'd buy the car. We agreed to meet somewhere in the middle and I headed out for Koreatown. The vehicle listing had some odd features to it, including a reference to the car being "woman owned"...but when the seller finally showed up it some guy and his dog. No worries, it was a small dog, but I wasn't sure how he'd intended to get himself and the dog home. 


The car was in far worse condition than the listing made it out to be. To start with, the top was substantially ripped. Looking back, this was a bit less of deal-breaker than the other features but I was certainly not having it. The body was a literally rough around the edges and there were aftermarket offbrand wheels installed. I talked with the seller about the car's history and he told me his girlfriend had gotten the car from her aunt. The car had signs of rust under the hood in weird places for a California car and the hood looked like it hadn't been opened in years. Cobwebs in the engine bay and unidentified gunk were pretty big turn offs, but the most important issue was the rim of fresh black grime around the top of the engine. There was definitely a leak. I got underneath the front end a bit and could see that the bottomside was entirely coated with oil. I let the seller know he was leaking oil and he seeemd more confused than anything. Walking around towards the back of the car I listed my concerns while apologizing for wasting his time. I focused on politely explaining why buying was out of the question for me and awkwardly speedwalked to my car, hopping in car with money in pocket. To my surprise he was not outwardly upset, but I sat for a moment collecting myself before leaving to get some milk tea. I guess the experience wasn't all bad. Sidestepped an artillery shell, surely, and got a nice drink.


## Weekday / Traffic Car

The daily driver has been a struggle for me. Budgeting for performance and reliability 
is easier said than done for a sedan or 2+2 coupe. I am still sort of interested in a hot 
hatch or wagon (Volvo or Saab, maybe?) but checking out a "spotless" 92-X Aero that had hidden subframe 
damage selling for $9,000 has sort of dampened my interest. 

I checked out a 300ZX 2+2 with a TT engine swapped in but it seemed like the vehicle would need several grand worth of work to bring it back to its former glory. The kid who owned it was plenty nice and was in a similar place in his car enthustist journey, but was at a very different stage in life. When we took the car out for a drive, I had him drive me around some to see how it was used/abused. He wasn't really sure where the second turbo kicked in since he usually short shifted it. He let me know that he only really revved it out to "show off to girls or something". Pobrecito, your 25 year old car held together with zip-ties that has body rattled as loud as it's exhaust is not impressing anyone.

The long and short of the inspection was that it would need to be checked out by a specialist if I wanted to have any sort of insurance against more serious mechanical problems (vacuum lines, turbos, engine health, etc.) and even if that was going to work out it would need some work before it was comfortable enough to daily. I'm not creaky old man, but I can afford some bare minimum refinements in a car that I will bring to work and out on dates. The awkwardly peeling trim elements and half detached aftermaket boost gauge complimented the unvacuumed rough carpets of the interior, but a grungy uncomfortable aesthetic is really not what I'm going for right now. 

Ordering a near mint interior, lower mileage 300ZX TT from Japan would only be a few grand more.
