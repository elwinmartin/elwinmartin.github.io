So when I get rid of my GTI I am going to need to replace it with a reasonably reliable daily driver. I would strongly prefer something incredibly reliable to remove the "headache" factor that comes into play with having many tiny repairs that may not cost much, so minimal service cost is going to take a premium over other features until I'm much more financially comfortable. I'm willing to trade some relibility for warranty, within reason, though.

I would like to keep my car payments well within my means so I can make progress on my student loans. Right now, my payments are very comfortable so I have some room to go up in monthly cost. Low payments with a longer term loan, perhaps at the expense of total cost, are on the table in exchange for peace of mind. The future is uncertain and if I need to move or change jobs I could use some padding.


I think this factors lead me to a either of a leased new car or a lightly used (fresh off a lease, perhaps) new-ish car. I will make an exception for older Hondas and Mazdas (NB/NC Miatas, I'm looking at you :P).


With that in mind, I am still looking at having a 'fun' car for the weekends. I would prefer it road legal and properly registered since I don't have money for a truck in addition. This, sadly, limits how dumb it can be. I am definitely not going to dump substantially more than the value of any car into modifications. An LS1 powered RX-8 or 300ZX would be great, but I don't plan to (and probably can't) dump like 10 grand of work into a car.

*Addenda: 8/11*

There are so, so many Lexus IS 250s and BMW 328is for sale that I am completely sick of them. I am sure there are people who would love to have either, but they are getting in the way when I look for RWD cars in my price range. Sorry car search engines. Thanks, but no thanks. 

## New Leased ##

For a daily driver I am hoping I don't have to compromise on space. I want space for two people and an instrument or two. A bass guitar makes a good reference point here. If I can't bring a bass guitar and an amp with another person, the car may be too impractical for me right now. As much as I would love to daily an ND Miata...you have to make a choice between bringing *a* (yes, one) friend or bringing stuff with you. This is hard to stomach for me right now, but I may only acquire more people and things in the next few years. This might be the best time to be impractical in a long time. 

Hatchbacks occupy my needs particularly well but I am could handle 2+2 with half-decent rear seats or even a _boring_ sedan if it leaves more cash for the fun car.  

I have zero qualms with an automatic transmission and think I would prefer something like a DSG for daily driving.


There are my main options, from most practical to least.

1. Honda Civic (Sport Trim)

2. Mazda 3 (2.5L Trim)

3. VW GTI (Base)

4. Toyobaru (Base)

The more expensive options might preclude a fun car, too.

## Used (Financed?) ##

Daily Driver Options:


* Hyundai Genesis (2.0L Turbo)

* Scion FRS (Base)

* BMW 228 i (Base)



I'm going to break down my options partially by brand here since that's going to make my life easier. There are a lot of options here, but let's be real with ourselves...the Miata is the clear front runner.

Weekend Cars:

1. Mazda Miata, Miata, Miata (NA/NB/NC)

2. C4 Corvette

3. Nissan 240SX / 300ZX

4. BMW Z3 / E36 M3

5. Honda S2000

6. Toyota MR2 Turbo or MR2 Spyder

7. Mustang

8. Lexus SC / Toyota Soarer
