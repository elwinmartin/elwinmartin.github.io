	2. Open source /free
	3. Good documentation
	4. JS callbacks / server communications
	5. Extensible?

Starting with a pandas dataframe
[Uses BokehJS to render in notebook]

Create a figure
Circle method renders glyphs [namely, circles]; it takes data
	Zoom features are nice 
	Can save to png straight from the figure

On mouse_over
	p.add_tools(HoverTool) # method to add a tool
	#

glyph properties can be modified nearly
	circ.glyph.size = 11 # or for color, etc. 

Widgets give interactivity 

Work space?
