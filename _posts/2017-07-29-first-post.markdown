Hi everyone,

I will be trying to regale you all with what is going on in my hobbies and professional life.

Content will be explicitly without direct reference to social or political themes to whatever extent possible.

That said, I cannot guarantee that this site will remain entirely professional - memery may ensue.

Looking forward to getting things rolling and adding content. We will see if I have enough to say to update weekly.

My immediate goal is simply to flesh out the projects page sufficiently that individual posts can refer to them.

Many, many minor edits will be coming through the first week or so as I tweak the templates and default text to my needs.

Stay tuned!

Best,

Me
