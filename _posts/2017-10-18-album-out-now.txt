We had a promotional video prepared, but it was made with the old band name and we never redid it so it just sort of died. I'm really pleased with how the album art came out. We used a lightly edited, candid photo of a sad scene Bijan came across in the weeks before the release. 

If you can't tell, it's most of a bag of Doritos spilled on the street. There's a pretty clear compression across the spill from where the chips were runover. 

Getting from start to finish was exhausting but it was a lot of fun. While I didn't learn quite as much from sitting in on the mastering sessions as the other guys, I did get a much better sense of what it takes to make high production quality music. There are a few sayings in the music business that boil down to the idea that while your mastering can make up for some of your mixing and your mixing can make up for some of your recording quality, you're better off just recording everything well in the first place. Some of the issues I take with the final product come down to choices in the mixing and others come down to the quality of the tracks we provided. We already have plans for a new microphone setup for the drums, going forward. 

We are going to focus on getting out and performing more for now. Having a complete album on a few platforms is a much more effective way to get shows than a Soundcloud link or two and it will be nice going out and doing more live shows. Looking forward to our next release! Hopefully it's a much less arduous journey.
