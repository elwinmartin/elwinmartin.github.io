Hi everyone,

I am going to try to  consistently chronicle my hobbies and professional life.

My social media accounts are fragmented and none of them really allows for long form writing. Hopefully this will fix that. 

Content will be explicitly without direct reference to social or political themes where I avoid it.

That said, I cannot guarantee that this site will remain entirely professional - memery may emerge.

Looking forward to getting things rolling and adding content. We will see if I have enough to say to update weekly.

My immediate goal is simply to flesh out the projects page sufficiently that individual posts can refer to them.

Many, many minor edits will sneak in during the first few week as I tweak the templates and default materials to my needs.

Stay tuned!

Best,

Me
