Just about three years ago I bought my first car. My 2007 VW GTI has been a bittersweet combination of joy and pain for me and I think I am approaching my limits as it reaches its bitter end.

There have been some ups and downs, but mostly downs at this point. While it has been the most fun of any car I have driven -- n.b. my limited experience -- it has had more problems than any car I can remember friends or family owning (except my brother's A3, which was almost the same car). I knew going in that this car was going to involve some repair costs. The reliability was often rated, at best, a 3.5/5 for this generation GTI. Through a combination of money down, decent negotiation, and public fear of older VWs I was able to sustain car payments of around ~$150 a month. 

While I have had my share of financial instability, the car payments have remained in-check despite various emergencies, and I do not regret the rate or amount I financed. 

Repairs, however, have been needed at random intervals and with great expense (up to $1700 in a single repair -- near the total I still owe). They're beginning to take a toll on my bank account and well being. What's worse, I'm not even finished fixing everything wrong.

The current suite of known problems include:

1. An SRS light (faulty airbag code)

2. Flashing CEL Under Load (cylinder 4 misfires at idle)

3. OBD 2 (O2 sensor not found)

4. Visual Inspection (Aftermarket exhaust not CARB compliant)

5. Cosmetic Damage / Age (minor dimples, stain carpeting, etc.)

6. Alignment and Axles (CV boots torn, alignment off)

7. Tires & Brakes (Okay, but just okay)

8. Suspension / Stance (Not a 'problem', strictly speaking)


The most recent issue (#2), is the most troubling as I cannot comfortably drive highway speeds without fear of spewing gasoline into my cat of breaking something in my engine. My roommate has a working vehicle, so for the time being I will be okay, but I would prefer to have transportation as soon as possible. I'm going to try to break down this and the other fixed to give a sense of what we're looking at for total car cost before I can either sell it or part it out.

The first thing this car needs is a professional detailing. I am not a used car expert, but I am fairly confident that it would lose hundreds of dollars off its functional worth in its current state. The biggest issue is general car cleanliness caused by my laziness followed by my brokeness. For a long stretch of time I was "just a weekend with free time" away from getting my car properly vacuumed. Similarly, I was "just a month" away from having the financial stability to spend $100-200 on a professional cleaning without risking my ability to buy groceries. I am pretty sure I have *finally* reached a point where both of these excuses are just that, excuses. That said, the detailing would cost some real money.
