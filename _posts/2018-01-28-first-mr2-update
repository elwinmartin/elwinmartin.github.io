Off to a good start already! 

Sort of.

## First Weekend Fun

So I got a rough quote for the rear end repairs and we also found a broken connection between the hood and the left headlight assembly. The headlights have yellowed some and I was already thinking about reconditioning them, but 
it might be worth simply replacing them. The guy was sort of half-helpful, half not. I think I might be able to get away with just replacing the bumper bar etc. myself and paying a bodyshop to fit the paneling.

On Sam's advice, I went to an alignment shop shortly after. The cars alignment is worse than I thought and I might need to look at the axles in the front, but it seems like my worries about uneven ride height were misplaced. The suspension in the back is fine, but the offset of the bumper / quarter panel is different which is why it looks lower on one side.   

Based on all this, I have decided to deal with brakes first as the parking brake is my biggest concern. I'll deal with the alignment properly when I get new tires since the ones on now are already showing uneven wear.

Driving is feeling more natural and I managed to get around all day Saturday without having any awkward moments stalling in traffic. Ironically, I tried to rush parking and stalled it in my parking spot, though, haha.

Getting a feel for the weight distribution is going to take a little while though. I went out with some friends late that Saturday evening and ran through a few canyon roads near Malibu. Sadly, that might've been some of the most challenging driving I've done. Modulating power and braking were my primary goals, but I didn't really push hard between tighter bends. Oversteer is fun, my friends, but kind of terrifying when you're not expecting it. My passenger was also not expecting it, but fortunately we were well, well within the limits of the car. Great learning experience and it's helped me realize just how slow I am. Looking forward to driving with people who know what they're doing again soon!

## The GTI is fully paid off!

Officially (rather than by my own accounting), my loan has $0 due. I will be receving the physical pink slip in the mail in 4-6 weeks!

I've got a photo of the reciept from the final deposit and I'm pleased knowing I can dump this car whenever it's right to.

The concern now is how much I'm willing to invest in it over the next several months (to a year?) while it's still driving *okay*. I have a feeling the times I was too broke to afford to deal with issues properly are going to have lead to some real problems that haven't surfaced fully, yet. 

## The Cash Fire Begins

I went ahead and bought a new brake cable. Since I was already on Amazon, I tried to bundle together a modest order of things for doing the rest of the brakes later. Anti-seize, threadlocker, brake fluid, and a pad spreader made up the rest of the order. 

About a half an hour later, I realized I should probably pick up a car cover, too. The thought came up first when speaking with a friend about how to elegantly leave the car on blocks if I get the suspension rebuilt, but the recent rains have really made me regret not having a cover given the ripped soft top. 

A few hours after that, the realization that I still had money in my pockets reminded me that my interior door handle also needs replacing. I ordered the part directly from Toyota and we'll see how installation goes. Removing the existing part in the dark didn't go terribly well for me.

I'm still waffling on buying new brake calipers or simply trying to replace the pistons / rebuild the ones I've got.
