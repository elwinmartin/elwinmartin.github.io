Since the outline of the project is available on my Python projects page [here](http://www.elwinmartin.com/python-projects), we're going to dive right in to some updates.

While a deployable app might be cool as a final product, building out backend functionality will be my focus for the foreseeable future.

Starting from the top, here are some notes on my first couple commits for this. 

For the sake of extensibility I am using YAML configuration files. Currently, there are only a handful of lines in the config, but this could change from adding functionality or data sources as this grows.


The ratio of import statements to code is almost silly at these early stages. The same is true comparing comments to code. 
I am still deciding on an environment for this project. So far none of the code has been run or tested, haha. 
Instead of running at each step, I have been focused on design and writing Pythonic code. This drafting phase is going to need to end sooner rather than later before I end up with a mountain of untested code.

The general flow of the code is straightforward:


1. Load configuration files
2. Load CLI Args
3. GET data for apartments
4. GET data for travel time by apartment
5. Filter on travel time
6. Return apartments

There are some formatting and presentation issues to keep track of, but internally, I think everything will be kept in dictionaries. I am tempted to return results as a CSV, though.
