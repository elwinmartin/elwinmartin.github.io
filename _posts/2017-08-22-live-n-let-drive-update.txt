*Minor update here*


So, it turns out that there's similar functionality available to what I envisioned available from Walkscore. 

Their approach is very powerful, but it is different than mine.

I think there's still some value in finishing the project for my own sake and because the functionality isn't quite the same.

That said, I will probably use Walkscore for finding my next apartment unless I can find a good way to aggregate
better apartment data than they have, haha...though maybe I could get things going with a nice normalized form for
housing listings...
