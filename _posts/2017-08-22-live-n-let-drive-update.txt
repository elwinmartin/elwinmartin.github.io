## Some Updates

So, it turns out that there's similar functionality available to what I envisioned available from Walkscore. 

Their approach is very powerful, but it looks like it's different from mine.

I think there's still some value in finishing the project for my own sake and because the functionality isn't quite the same.

That said, I will probably use Walkscore for finding my next apartment unless I can find a good way to aggregate
better apartment data than they have, haha...though maybe I could get things going with a nice normalized form for
housing listings...anyways, that is a while off.

In the meantime, I have made some light functionality changes and have decided to go with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as
the web framework for this project. The routing for this will be trivial, but I did setup a hello world route and checked that it served nicely.

I think the only page routes I would need are '/', 'contact', and '/about' for the forseeable future. The contact and about pages will be static. The base page will accept 'GET' and 'POST' requests, using the latter for handling user input. 

Use two frameworks as a study...
