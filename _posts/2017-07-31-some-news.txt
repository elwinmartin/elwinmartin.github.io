Couple quick updates for everyone :D

It looks like I'm going to be participating in a Game Jam with some friends!

Nobody on my team has any real game development experience, but we are hoping to scope out some simple platforms in the next few weeks.

So I am looking for a new apartment and one of the biggest concerns I have is my commute. Short of saving me quite a lot in rent, I would be hard pressed to make any move that increases the time it takes me to get to work and back. Unfortunately, distance on a map is a bad surrogate for actual time spent in a car in many cities (I'm looking at you ATL). 

What I really want is to look at apartments that are:

* The correct number of bedrooms
* The correct number of bathrooms
* Have parking
* Within my price range
* Within a reasonable commute time

Everything except for the last item can be done by a simple listing website like Craglist. This isn't really too much to ask, though; fortunately, map softwares have public APIs!

My short term project for the moment is going to be getting a version of this functionality built out in Python before I have to pick a place to move. Since the terms of my lease specified today as my last day, we'll see if that happens (full disclosure: my landlord hasn't even called to ask if we're moving out, haha, so we're probably fine).
