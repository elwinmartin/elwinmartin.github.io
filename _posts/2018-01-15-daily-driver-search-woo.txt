So since I've got my track car, we're halfway done! This search is going to continue at the same slow pace, however, since I will be aiming for something costly enough to require saving up for a down payment. I think I'm committed to buying something *relatively* inexpensive and hoping to outlive the cost of the loan if possible. With that in mind, let's review what I'm looking for


<!--more-->

The following is what I've deemed important for a daily driver (in order):

0. Four seats
1. $$\leq 12,000$$ USD
2. Power to weight (really, torque to weight) $$\stackrel{>=}{\sim}$$ better than my GTI
3. Quick transmission
4. Steering feel
5. AWD $$>=$$ RWD $$>>$$ FWD 
6. $$< 3,500$$ lbs

The daily driver has been a struggle for me. Budgeting for performance and reliability 
is easier said than done for a sedan or 2+2 coupe. I am still sort of interested in a hot 
hatch or wagon (Volvo or Saab, maybe?) but checking out a "spotless" 92-X Aero that had hidden subframe 
damage selling for $9,000 has sort of dampened my interest. 

I checked out a 300ZX 2+2 with a TT engine swapped in but it seemed like the vehicle would need several grand worth of work to bring it back to its former glory.
